his project demonstrates how to build a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to predict the next character in a sequence.
Character-Level Text Generation with RNNs
This project showcases a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras to predict the next character in a sequence. The notebook is optimized for Google Colab, requiring no additional setup.

Features
✔ Simple RNN Model – Predicts the next character in a sequence.
✔ Google Colab Ready – Runs directly in the browser with no installation needed.
✔ Training Visualization – Plots accuracy and loss over epochs.
✔ Text Generation – Generates new text based on a seed input.

How to Use
Open in Google Colab – Run the notebook directly here (add Colab link if hosted).

Execute Cells Sequentially – Run each code block step-by-step.

Experiment – Modify hyperparameters (epochs, sequence length) or try different input texts.
